<!-- Short Bio -->
<p align="center">I am a professional with a background in <b>geology</b>, who, due to life's circumstances, acquired various <b>IT skills</b> initially through self-teaching. My ability to <b>adapt</b> and <b>learn</b> allowed me to be promoted <b>three times</b>, even leading to the creation of a specific position due to my advancements. Recently, I completed a <b>bootcamp</b> and obtained the title of <b>Data Scientist and Analyst</b>, demonstrating my ability to <b>reinvent myself</b> and adapt to the challenges that arise.</p>
